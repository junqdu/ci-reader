    "a": "Yep, you can do that. Tapping the Frog after it's been declared as a blocker won't remove it from combat or prevent any damage from being dealt, so you're free to block with the Frog, then tap the Frog for mana and use that mana to activate its ability and give the Frog deathtouch."

    "a": "Since Adeline is a creature, when the Tidebinder's trigger resolves and counters the ability, that will also cause Adeline to lose all of its abilities for as long as the Tidebinder is on the battlefield. That includes Adeline's characteristic-defining ability that sets its power (before it can apply). Since Adeline's power is undefined, it becomes 0, and Adeline will end up as a 0/4 creature for as long as the Tidebinder is in play, no matter how many creatures they control."

And since the Anchorage is currently a creature, the Tidebender will make the Anchorage lose all of its abilities for as long as the Tidebender is on the battlefield. It will still be a 2/3 creature for the turn, but once the turn is over, it goes back to just being a land - but still with none of its abilities, since it's still affected by the Tidebender's ability. So your opponent will have a Restless Anchorage that can't tap for mana or turn itself into a creature."

And extort cares about how much life your opponents just lost from the extort trigger.

Blood Moon makes nonbasic lands into Mountains in layer 4, but Wrenn and Realmbreaker doesn't give your lands the activated ability until later, in layer 6.

Now the 6/6 Yorvo sees its power is still less than the 10/10 Gigantosaurus, so it would get another +1/+1 counter, which becomes two +1/+1 counters because of Hardened Scales again, and Yorvo ends up as a 8/8.

By the time you're putting the trigger from Trail of Crumbs on the stack, you already have that mana from the Goose, so you'll be able to pay for the Trail's trigger by using the mana you got from the Goose to pay for it."

    "a": "No you do not. The creature is destroyed by your opponent's Doom Blade, and when state-based actions are checked, the game sees the Wicked Role token isn't attached to anything and it goes to the graveyard. This is a state-based action, not a spell or ability controlled by an opponent, so Karmic Justice won't trigger and you won't get to destroy an opponent's permanent in return."

But a modal double-faced card like Shatterskull Smashing only has the characteristics of the front face unless you're playing or casting it.

While you can sacrifice the Treasure token during announcement of the Angler before you pay costs, delve only lets you exile <i>cards</i> to help pay for the spell, and a token is not a card.

    "a": "No you will not. When resolving the Will, we follow the instructions in the order they're listed on the card. First, we deal the damage to creature, but Vrondiss still has the Transformation attached to it, so it's a 3/3 Elk. Then we destroy the Transformation.

Since you control both of those triggers, you choose the order they're put on the stack.
