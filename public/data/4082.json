    "q": "Can Everybody Lives! prevent me from losing the game due to having 10 or more poison counters?",
    "a": "Sure. An Adventure card is a permanent card that has a split text box. The left side has an instant or sorcery spell, and the right side has a normal text box. You can either cast the Alchemist normally, in which case it behaves like any other creature. Or you can cast it via Adventure. If you cast it via Adventure, while it's on the stack, it has its Adventure characteristics instead of its creature characteristics. In this case, you're casting a sorcery spell named Bubble Up with a mana value of 3. When the Adventure spell resolves, instead of going to the graveyard, you put it in exile, and then later on, you can cast the creature card from exile. (If it's exiled this way, you can only cast the creature, you can't cast the instant/sorcery again.)"

    "a": "You cannot. The Adventure characteristics also affect the card's color identity. While the Dragon itself is just red, the Adventure part of the card has a black mana symbol in its mana cost, so the color identity of the Dragon is red and black, and cannot be played in a mono-red Commander deck."

    "a": "A Role token is a new type of enchantment token. They're predefined Aura tokens that can be attached to a creature. Six of them are featured in the main set, while a seventh is only available in the Commander decks. Usually, the token is a boon for the creature - it can involve a +1/+1 bonus and gives the enchanted creature an ability.  The Cursed Role token is an exception, since it makes the enchanted creature into a 1/1 creature, so try to put that one on your opponent's creatures."

    "a": "Unfortunately for you, it can only fill one role for you at a time. If a creature has multiple Role tokens attached to it that are controlled by the same player, you keep the newest Role and the other ones go to the graveyard. In this case, the Troll will lose the Monstrous Role that it originally had and will only have the Wicked Role."

    "a": "Not quite. The Roles have to be controlled by the same player for one of them to go away. While you're free to attach your own Role token to the creature that's enchanted by your opponent's Cursed Role token, since they're controlled by different players, they'll both exist on the creature."

    "a": "Yep, you'll get the trigger. Just like how a token creature will go to the graveyard long enough to trigger any dies abilities, the Role token will go to the graveyard for a brief time before state-based actions cause the Role token to cease to exist, but since it did go to the graveyard, the Reaper's ability will trigger."

You have two effects that say your white and/or blue spells cost <img src=\"/ci-reader/images/symbols/2.png\" class=\"mana\"> less to cast, so both discounts apply and your white and blue spells cost a total of <img src=\"/ci-reader/images/symbols/4.png\" class=\"mana\"> less to cast."

    "a": "Yep, it can. If the Saga itself is a token, you can target it with the trigger and make a copy of the Saga. That copy will enter with a lore counter, triggering its chapter I trigger, and it will get lore counters like normal. This can get out of hand very fast, since every time you get to chapter II or III with each Three Blind Mice, you can make another token copy of it."

    "a": "Nope, just one counter. The trigger says you may remove a counter, which is singular, so you can only choose to remove one counter from the Prodigy each time the trigger resolves. Even if it has multiple counters on it, you can still only remove one counter each turn."

    "a": "No, you're misreading the card a little bit. The abilities that the equipment has is \"Equipped creature gets +3/+3\" and the equip 3 ability. The Irencrag loses its other abilities, so it no longer has the ability to tap for mana or the trigger to transform into the equipment, but losing all abilities only affects The Irencrag itself, not the creature the equipment becomes attached to."

The Conquest doesn't target, you just choose permanents to sacrifice when it resolves, then choose that many creature cards to return based on how many permanents you just sacrificed. You could sacrifice an artifact creature, then choose to return the artifact creature you just sacrificed to the battlefield."

    "a": "No it does not. There's a difference between being an \"enchanted creature\" and being an \"enchantment creature\". An enchanted creature is a creature that has an Aura attached to it. The Courser doesn't count as an enchanted creature, so it won't get +2/+2 from the Tale unless you attach an Aura to it."

When Grist is exiled to the Soul Cauldron's ability, your creatures with +1/+1 counters on the will gain all of Grist's loyalty abilities. Keep in mind a few things though - your creatures start out with zero loyalty counters on them (since they're not planeswalkers), and your creatures can still only activate one loyalty ability per turn, and only during one of your main phases when the stack is empty (since those restrictions are built into the rules for loyalty abilities, not built into the planeswalker type)."

For much of Standard's history, it's consisted of the last two years of set releases, but now that's expanding to the last three years worth of sets. That means that we won't be getting a normal rotation this fall, so when <i>Wilds of Eldraine</i> becomes Constructed legal, nothing will rotate out of Standard.
