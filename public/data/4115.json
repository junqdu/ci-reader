    "a": "Yes, it does! All combat damage from these three creatures is dealt simultaneously, then after damage is dealt state based actions are checked, by which point the Shadow has grown to be a 6/6 with 3 damage marked on it. Note that the Shadow only dealt 3 damage during this combat."

    "a": "The Bear Cub will deal 18 damage. It's power is 3 with the +1/+1 counter. Then it has two replacement effects that try to increase the damage. It doesn't matter the order in this case as both multiply the damage, so we will get to the same result, but it's worth noting the player being injured chooses the order these replacement effects will be applied."

In casual games and at Regular REL, you may place your cards on your portion of the table as you see fit so long as it's clear what cards are what and you're not hiding some cards by placing some cards over others.
