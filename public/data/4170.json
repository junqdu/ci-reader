    "a": "Yes, it will. That's 12 damage to each creature defending player controls. Roaming Throne can double-trigger triggered abilities even if the creature doesn't innately have those abilities and gains them through other means (such as <span class=\"autocard\">Diviner's Wand</span>, <span class=\"autocard\">Grasp of the Hieromancer</span>, and <span class=\"autocard\">Flash Conscription</span>)."

    "a": "You will not. The trigger for putting counters on Jitte is on Jitte, it is not a trigger Jitte grants to the Bear Cub. For Roaming Throne to be relevant, the creature has to be given the trigger, this is usually indicated by being put in between quotation marks. See the examples I used in the answer of the last question."

I choose mode one targeting myself and mode two targeting my opponent's <span class=\"autocard\">Bear Cub</span>. Does Imodane trigger to punch my opponents for 5 damage each?<br>",
    "a": "She does not. Imodane requires that the only target of the spell be a single creature. In the example you give, the Command targets both you and a creature. The Command has four modes, and each mode has a target, so any two modes you choose will lead to more than one target creature, with one exception. If you choose mode two and four and have both target the same enemy creature, then and only then would Imodane trigger from a Mishra's Command. (I suppose in a super rare situation its also possible for her to trigger if the opponent's planeswalker was also a creature and you choose it for the targets of both modes two and three)."

    "q": "Same set up as the last question. Can I sacrifice the Treasure (aka, Slicer) before giving it back to my opponent at end of turn?<br>",

Help?<br>",
    "a": "So all three triggers are controlled by the same player (you, the Nekusar player). This means you get to put them on the stack in the order of your choosing. They resolve in the reverse order you put them on the stack (last in first out). You have six options as how to stack them."

Does Xenagos still enter the battlefield even though it won't be a creature? If so, is it tapped? If so, is it attacking?<br>",
    "a": "Yes, yes, and no. Xenagos is always a creature in every zone other than the battlefield. The Doors only care if Xenagos is a creature in the library, and it is, so it gets placed on the battlefield. The instructions say to put it onto the battlefield tapped, enchantments can be tapped, so it will be placed tapped. However, only creatures can attack or be attacking, so it won't be attacking."

    "a": "If you choose your trigger order correctly, yes you can. Both Closet and the sacrifice trigger trigger at the same time and you control both triggers, so you can put them on the stack in the order of your choosing. If the Closet trigger resolves before the sacrifice, then the Bear will be a new object with no relation to its previous form and so won't get sacrificed to the trigger set up by the Necromancer."

    "a": "The haste gained by Shivan Dragon is not a copiable characteristic, so the token won't have haste.

    "a": "The tokens created by the myriad trigger will only be 5/5s. Unnatural Growth doubles the p/t of your creatures at the beginning of combat before attacks are declared (this is before the tokens are made). And similar to the Miirym question earlier, boosts to a creature's p/t are not copiable values, so the copies will be unaltered versions of Calamity."

However, Commander has variants that include sideboards, if your play group wants to allow them, then you can pull from the sideboard. Or if your group wants to go crazy, they can just let you pull from any cards you have with you, just understand you need permission beforehand, and it's not allowed in the normal Commander rules."

    "a": "No, it does not. Tidebinder's trigger can only counter triggered abilities (usually including the words <span class=\"autocard\">Angel of Mercy</span>, <span class=\"autocard\">Ajani's Welcome</span>, or <span class=\"autocard\">Ajani's Mantra</span>) or activated abilities (written in the form <span class=\"autocard\">Rummaging Goblin</span>).

    "a": "You don't have to following timing restrictions and you can miracle sorceries, creatures, artifacts, and other non-instants drawn during an opponent's turn.

Can I respond to Kozi's shuffle ability with my Stone of Erech to prevent Kozi or any other cards from getting shuffled back into my opponent's library?<br>",
    "a": "Yes, you can. Kozi's shuffle ability is a triggered ability that goes on the stack, and before it can resolve each player gets at least one priority pass to use activated abilities and/or instants. Stone of Erech is an activated ability that isn't limited to sorcery speed so you're golden to exile Kozi and the rest of your opponent's graveyard."

Will the Yearling still get to change its power to 6 this turn?<br>",
    "a": "It will. When the Yearling's trigger resolves, it will see the Dreadmaw is dead, and so will use last known information to determine its size. The last time Dreadmaw was on the battlefield it had 6 power, so the Yearling can have its power changed to 6 this turn."
