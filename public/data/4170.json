    "a": "You will not. The trigger for putting counters on Jitte is on Jitte, it is not a trigger Jitte grants to the Bear Cub. For Roaming Throne to be relevant, the creature has to be given the trigger, this is usually indicated by being put in between quotation marks. See the examples I used in the answer of the last question."

    "a": "She does not. Imodane requires that the only target of the spell be a single creature. In the example you give, the Command targets both you and a creature. The Command has four modes, and each mode has a target, so any two modes you choose will lead to more than one target creature, with one exception. If you choose mode two and four and have both target the same enemy creature, then and only then would Imodane trigger from a Mishra's Command. (I suppose in a super rare situation its also possible for her to trigger if the opponent's planeswalker was also a creature and you choose it for the targets of both modes two and three)."

    "q": "Same set up as the last question. Can I sacrifice the Treasure (aka, Slicer) before giving it back to my opponent at end of turn?",

Even with Xenagos on the battlefield I would only have a devotion of five. Does Xenagos still enter the battlefield even though it won't be a creature? If so, is it tapped? If so, is it attacking?",
    "a": "Yes, yes, and no. Xenagos is always a creature in every zone other than the battlefield. The Doors only care if Xenagos is a creature in the library, and it is, so it gets placed on the battlefield. The instructions say to put it onto the battlefield tapped, enchantments can be tapped, so it will be placed tapped. However, only creatures can attack or be attacking, so it won't be attacking."

    "a": "If you choose your trigger order correctly, yes you can. Both Closet and the sacrifice trigger trigger at the same time and you control both triggers, so you can put them on the stack in the order of your choosing. If the Closet trigger resolves before the sacrifice, then the Bear will be a new object with no relation to its previous form and so won't get sacrificed to the trigger set up by the Necromancer."

    "a": "The tokens created by the myriad trigger will only be 5/5s. Unnatural Growth doubles the p/t of your creatures at the beginning of combat before attacks are declared (this is before the tokens are made). And similar to the Miirym question earlier, boosts to a creature's p/t are not copiable values, so the copies will be unaltered versions of Calamity."

    "a": "So when playing with normal Commander rules, there is no outside the game zone to choose cards from, so you can really only discard and draw a card with the learn ability. However, Commander has variants that include sideboards, if your play group wants to allow them, then you can pull from the sideboard. Or if your group wants to go crazy, they can just let you pull from any cards you have with you, just understand you need permission beforehand, and it's not allowed in the normal Commander rules."

So if I drew and revealed Temporal Mastery during my opponent's turn by casting Opt, can I Miracle it even though it's a sorcery and it's my opponent's turn?",
    "a": "You don't have to following timing restrictions and you can miracle sorceries, creatures, artifacts, and other non-instants drawn during an opponent's turn. In fact, you are ignoring timing restrictions when you miracle them during your own turn as you are casting them during your draw step, and not during your main phase with an empty stack."

Can I respond to Kozi's shuffle ability with my Stone of Erech to prevent Kozi or any other cards from getting shuffled back into my opponent's library?",
    "a": "Yes, you can. Kozi's shuffle ability is a triggered ability that goes on the stack, and before it can resolve each player gets at least one priority pass to use activated abilities and/or instants. Stone of Erech is an activated ability that isn't limited to sorcery speed so you're golden to exile Kozi and the rest of your opponent's graveyard."

    "a": "It will. When the Yearling's trigger resolves, it will see the Dreadmaw is dead, and so will use last known information to determine its size. The last time Dreadmaw was on the battlefield it had 6 power, so the Yearling can have its power changed to 6 this turn."

    "a": "Abilities that trigger from a spell being cast don't trigger until the spell is fully cast. Paying costs, including additional costs like casualty, are paid for earlier in the process of casting a spell. Therefore, casualty will trigger morbid even if both are on the same spell."
