    "q": "Can Everybody Lives! prevent me from losing the game due to having 10 or more poison counters?",
    "a": "No, that won't work. Banishing Light's exile effect happens due to its enter-the-battlefield ability, and your opponent's Elesh Norn shuts down all enter-the-battlefield abilities of your permanents. You can play Banishing Light, but it'll just sit uselessly on the battlefield."

    "a": "No. While Jailbreak has a reflexive trigger that triggers when a permanent enters the battlefield, Elesh Norn only causes triggered abilities of permanents you control to trigger an additional time. The resolving Jailbreak is a sorcery on the stack, not a permanent on the battlefield, so its trigger is not affected by Elesh Norn's ability."

    "a": "You pay the entire cumulative upkeep cost in one action, so you put two -1/-1 counters on Aboroth, which constitutes one event in which you put one or more counters on a permanent. This means you get one trigger that deals 2 damage, which is bad news for you if you were hoping to mow down two 1/1s."

    "a": "It'll enter untapped. The Portal's effect causes the creature to enter the battlefield as a Phyrexian, as opposed to putting it onto the battlefield first and then turning it into a Phyrexian. Since it enters the battlefield as a Phyrexian, Phyrexian Censor is not interested in making it enter the battlefield tapped."

    "a": "It still deals 3 damage, since the reflexive trigger only cares about how many cards you chose to reveal. It doesn't care how many of those cards are still in your hand when the reflexive trigger resolves. In order to prevent you from revealing the card, your opponent would have to respond to the enter-the-battlefield ability itself, before they know for sure whether that last card in your hand is a Dragon card. We'll just assume that you gave your opponent the chance to do that and they chose not to. If you rushed things and revealed your Dragon card without giving your opponent the chance to respond to the enter-the-battlefield ability, a judge would most likely rewind the game to allow your opponent to respond to the enter-the-battlefield ability."

    "a": "Yes and no. The spells you cast from exile will have two instances of convoke, but that doesn't do anything more than just having one instance of convoke. Convoke isn't a triggered ability that makes mana when you tap creatures. It's a static ability that allows you to pay for mana symbols in the spell's total cost by other means, and having two instances of that ability is redundant."

An effect that creates a token defines the token's base characteristics, and it might also set up additional effects or include additional instructions. Jinnie Fay replaces the base characteristics and leaves the additional effects and instructions alone. However, toxic 1 and the can't block ability are all part of the base characteristics that White Sun's Twilight defines, so Jinnie Fay replaces those with the characteristics of a hasty Cat or vigilant Dog."

    "a": "Yes. Incubate N means \"create an Incubator token that enters the battlefield with N +1/+1 counters on it.\" The part that makes the token enter the battlefield with +1/+1 counters is not an ability that's given to the token, it's an additional instruction to you that you carry out as you create the token.

    "a": "I'm afraid so. Once a new turn begins, \"this turn\" now refers to a turn in which no mana values have been noted yet. Therefore, \"the greatest number noted for it this turn\" is an undefined quantity, so the game uses 0 until a card gets exiled and its mana value gets noted during this new turn."

    "a": "No. Liesa doesn't rewrite Murder from \"destroy target creature\" to \"exile target creature\". Its ability simply watches the game for any events in which a creature would die, and any such events get modified at the moment they're happening so that the creature is exiled instead. This means that Liesa's effect only kicks in if an effect would actually attempt to destroy a creature. If a creature is indestructible, destroying it is impossible, so the event that Liesa is supposed to replace is not happening in the first place. You can still target the creature with Murder, but Murder does nothing to it."

With Flicker, Thousand Winds goes from being face-down on the battlefield to being face-up in the exile zone, and then it is returned to the battlefield as a new object that's a face-up Thousand Winds.

This triggers Eternal Witness's enter-the-battlefield ability, but that ability only goes on the stack after Command the Dreadhorde has finished resolving and has gone to the graveyard.
