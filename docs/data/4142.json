The short answer is what is actually killing the Voidwalker. <br>\nWrath of God kills the Voidwalker, because it destroys all creatures. So Voidwalker goes to the graveyard, before the Wrath finishes resolving and attempts to go to the graveyard itself.<br>\nLightning Bolt, however, does not kill the Voidwalker, instead the Voidwalker is destroyed by state based actions.

Carl's will again resolve first, for which Becky will choose to tap her Vampire, giving no token to Carl. Then Becky is forced to give Amy a Vampire when Amy's trigger resolves.

Becky's resolves first, and Carl chooses not to tap his Vampire, so Becky gets a token. Before we move onto Amy's trigger (which has two Amy triggers below it, and has Becky's original at the bottom) we now create two triggers above that, one for Carl and one for Amy.<br>\nThis repeats where Carl and Becky each get a creature and Amy's triggers just stack up not currently resolving (and the one Becky trigger at the very bottom not resolving either). If at some point one of the Conquerors leaves that battlefield, then each of Amy's triggers will resolve (along with the lone Becky trigger). Though what happens from there depends on which Conqueror went away. If Carl or Becky's Conqueror died, Amy should choose to have all her tokens become tapped so no more Vampires are made. This will roughly give each player the same number of Vampire tokens.<br>\nOr she could choose to make a deal with the player who still has a Conqueror and Amy and them could choose to make any number of Vampires in the same way as Question #16.<br>\nHowever, if Amy's Conqueror went away, things get weird again.<br>\nAmy must give a Vampire to Becky for each Vampire Amy makes. She has the option to give Carl anywhere from zero Vampires up to as many Vampires as Amy makes. Additionally, at any time, Becky can choose to make any number of additional Vampires with Carl in the same way as Question #16.<br>"
