I know which creature is being targeted by the original Spectra Ward, and I assume my opponent will copy Spectra Ward with Spiritdancer. Is there any time between when I'll know the target of the copy of Spectra Ward but before it gains protection from all colors so I can tap it down with Decision Paralysis?"
