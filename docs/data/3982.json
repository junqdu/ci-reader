    "a": "Oathbreaker is a format similar to Commander, but instead of building around a legendary creature, you build around a planeswalker paired with an instant or sorcery spell. Instead of a 100 card deck, your deck is 60 cards including your Oathbreaker and signature spell, and you start with 20 life instead of 40 life. But Oathbreaker still has singleton rules, and you're still restricted by cards in your Oathbreaker's color identity."

    "a": "A signature spell is an instant or sorcery card that also starts out the game in the command zone, along with your Oathbreaker. Your signature spell's color identity has to be within the color identity of your Oathbreaker, and can be cast from the command zone, but only if your Oathbreaker is on the battlefield and under your control."

    "q": "Will Return the Past let me cast an adventure spell from my graveyard like Lupari Shield from my graveyard?",
    "a": "You could, but it won't work. Your signature spell can effectively exist in one of two zones - the command zone or the stack. If your signature spell would try to go anywhere else, you move it back to the command zone instead. So while you could pay the buyback cost when you cast Capsize, instead of going to your hand when it resolves, it ends up back in the command zone."

    "q": "I control Alistair, the Brigadier, four lands, and four Treasures. When I attack with Alistair, if I sacrifice those Treasures to pay for his triggered ability, will those Treasures count for the bonus that Alistair gives my creatures?",
    "a": "You cannot. You can only suspend a card if it's in your hand, not in the command zone, so you can't try to suspend your signature spell from the command zone. Even if you could, since your signature spell can only exist in the command zone or the stack, it wouldn't go to exile at all."

    "a": "Yeah, the Approach probably isn't the best choice for a signature spell. While you do end up moving the Approach back to the command zone instead of putting it into your library, if you want to win the game, you have to cast the Approach from your hand the second time you cast it. Casting it from the command zone doesn't count as casting it from your hand, so having the Approach as your signature spell means you're spending a lot of mana to gain 7 life."

Lighting Bolt is Rowan Kenrith's signature spell, so you'll need to have Rowan Kenrith in play to be able to cast the Bolt. Only having Will Kenrith in play will not let you cast Rowan's signature spell."

    "a": "No it cannot. It has to be a planeswalker on the front face for it to be your Oathbreaker. Tibalt is a planeswalker, but Tibalt is on the back face of the card, not the front face. Since the front face is not a planeswalker, Valki/Tibalt cannot be your Oathbreaker."

    "a": "Yep, the commander tax works the same in Oathbreaker as it does in Commander - each time you want to cast your Oathbreaker or signature spell from the command zone, you have to pay an additional <img src=\"/ci-reader/images/symbols/2.png\" class=\"mana\"> for each time you've previously cast it from the command zone. But like partner in Commander, the commander tax is tracked separately for your Oathbreaker and your signature spell - casting your Oathbreaker won't affect the commander tax for your signature spell and vice versa."

    "a": "Nope, there's no commander damage in Oathbreaker, which makes sense - most Oathbreakers can't turn themselves into creatures and can't attack. You can attack your opponent with your Oathbreaker Gideon all you want, but they won't lose the game if they take 21 or more points of combat damage from your Gideon."

    "a": "Nope, that also doesn't work here. There's no outside the game to reference, just like in Commander. While Karn's -2 will let you get an exiled artifact card back into your hand, it won't let you get an artifact card from outside the game."

    "a": "Oddly enough, yes, at least at the time of this article being posted. Based on the previous question, since we replace \"commander\" with \"oathbreaker\", Shorikai's last ability says that Shorikai can be your Oathbreaker. So if you'd like to have a vehicle as your Oathbreaker, you can play Shorikai."

    "a": "You can still return a creature card to your hand. The trigger from Emrakul can't go on the stack until after Tyvar's ability is completely done resolving. You'll be able to return a creature card before Emrakul's trigger can go on the stack and shuffle your graveyard into your library."

    "a": "No, the emblem is't doing anything right now. The emblem requires you to control a Gideon planeswalker for its effect to work. And while you do control Gideon of the Trials, because of Luxior, it's not a planeswalker - it's just a creature, and its subtype isn't Gideon anymore either, since that's a planeswalker subtype. So while you do control Gideon of the Trials, you don't control a planeswalker Gideon, so your emblem won't stop you from losing the game."

    "a": "Nope, your creature is safe. During the cleanup step, the effect from Saheeli wears off, and the Wargear goes back to being a Servo. Since it's now a creature, state-based actions will cause it to unattach. But it's no longer a Wargear when it becomes unattached, so the Wargear's unattach ability will not trigger and you won't sacrifice the creature that the Servo Wargear was attached to."

    "a": "Yep, you can. The ability just requires up to two target creatures, not creatures you control. And as a bonus, if those creatures were to deal combat damage, you will be the one to draw the card, not the controller of the creature (which may make blocking or attacking with those creatures a little less appealing for your opponent)."

Since Dihada has protection from everything, it can't be targeted, have anything attached to it, and all damage that would be dealt to it is prevented. Dihada could still be attacked, but the damage dealt by that attacking creature to Dihada is prevented (and Dihada would not lose any loyalty counters)."

If you play it during your first main phase, when you get to your second main phase, because the Carpet hasn't added mana that turn, the Carpet will trigger and you can get mana from its triggered ability."
